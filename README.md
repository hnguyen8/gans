# DCGAN for Numerical Simulation
A DCGAN model is trained on a Simulation of thermal convection and outputs a 256 x 256 fake image of the simulation.
For more details, see the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/hnguyen8/gans/blob/main/DCGAN_sim_2.ipynb).
# Environment
The jupyter notebook was implemented to run in Google Colab, and was given access to user's Google Drive. Inputs and Outputs are saved in their Drive.
